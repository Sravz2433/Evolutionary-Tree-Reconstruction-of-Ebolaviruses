# Evolutionary Tree Reconstruction of Ebolaviruses

## Project Overview
This project focuses on reconstructing an evolutionary tree of ebolaviruses to gain insights into their genetic diversity, evolutionary relationships, and transmission patterns. Using maximum likelihood methods, genomic sequences from 10 variants retrieved from GenBank were analyzed to identify the origin of the pathogen responsible for the recent outbreak in Africa.

## Key Highlights
- Reconstructed an evolutionary tree of ebolaviruses using maximum likelihood methods.
- Analyzed genomic sequences of 10 ebolavirus variants retrieved from GenBank.
- Identified the origin of the pathogen responsible for the recent outbreak in Africa.
- Provided insights into the evolutionary relationships, genetic diversity, and transmission patterns of the virus.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Tools and Software:** MEGA, Clustal Omega, Python, IQ-TREE

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure that the following tools are installed:
1. **MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis):**
   - Download: [MEGA Software](https://www.megasoftware.net/)
2. **Clustal Omega:** A tool for multiple sequence alignment.
   - Installation Guide: [Clustal Omega Documentation](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/)
3. **Python:** For scripting and sequence preprocessing.
   - Download: [Python Official Site](https://www.python.org/)
4. **IQ-TREE:** A tool for phylogenetic tree construction.
   - Installation Guide: [IQ-TREE Documentation](http://www.iqtree.org/)

### Dataset
Download genomic sequences of ebolavirus variants from GenBank ([GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)). Save the sequences in FASTA format for analysis.

## Methodology

### 1. Sequence Alignment
- Use **Clustal Omega** to perform multiple sequence alignment of the ebolavirus genomic sequences.
- Save the aligned sequences in a suitable format (e.g., PHYLIP).

### 2. Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction
- Import the aligned sequences into **IQ-TREE**.
- Apply maximum likelihood methods to reconstruct the evolutionary tree.
- Use appropriate substitution models and bootstrap analysis for reliability.

### 3. Analysis
- Visualize the tree using **MEGA**.
- Analyze the tree to identify evolutionary relationships and genetic diversity among the variants.
- Interpret the origin and transmission patterns of the pathogen.

## Results and Findings
- Reconstructed an accurate evolutionary tree depicting relationships among 10 ebolavirus variants.
- Identified genetic markers and evolutionary patterns linked to recent outbreaks.
- Provided evidence of transmission dynamics and potential origins of the pathogen.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the application of computational methods to study the evolution of ebolaviruses. The findings contribute to understanding the genetic diversity and transmission patterns, which are essential for outbreak management and vaccine development.
