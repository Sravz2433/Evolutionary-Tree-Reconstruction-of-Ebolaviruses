# Evolutionary Tree Reconstruction of Ebolaviruses

## Project Overview
This project focuses on reconstructing an evolutionary tree of ebolaviruses to understand their genetic diversity, evolutionary relationships, and transmission patterns. Genomic sequences from 10 variants retrieved from GenBank were analyzed using computational methods, including maximum likelihood algorithms, to identify the origin of the pathogen responsible for the 2014 outbreak in Africa.

## Key Highlights
- Reconstructed an evolutionary tree of ebolaviruses using maximum likelihood methods.
- Analyzed genomic sequences of 10 ebolavirus variants from GenBank.
- Identified the likely origin of the pathogen responsible for the 2014 outbreak.
- Provided insights into the evolutionary relationships, genetic diversity, and transmission pathways of the virus.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Tools and Software:** MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis), Clustal Omega, Python, IQ-TREE.
- **Languages:** Python for preprocessing and analysis scripting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure that the following tools are installed:
1. **MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis):**
   - Download: [MEGA Software](https://www.megasoftware.net/)
2. **Clustal Omega:** A tool for multiple sequence alignment.
   - Installation Guide: [Clustal Omega Documentation](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/)
3. **Python:** For scripting and sequence preprocessing.
   - Download: [Python Official Site](https://www.python.org/)
4. **IQ-TREE:** A powerful tool for phylogenetic tree construction.
   - Installation Guide: [IQ-TREE Documentation](http://www.iqtree.org/)

### Dataset
Download genomic sequences of ebolavirus variants from GenBank ([GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)). Save the sequences in FASTA format for further analysis.

## Methodology

### 1. Sequence Alignment
- Perform multiple sequence alignment using **Clustal Omega**.
- Save the aligned sequences in a format compatible with phylogenetic analysis (e.g., PHYLIP or FASTA).

### 2. Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction
- Import the aligned sequences into **IQ-TREE**.
- Apply maximum likelihood methods to reconstruct the evolutionary tree.
- Select an appropriate substitution model and conduct bootstrap analysis to assess reliability.

### 3. Visualization and Analysis
- Visualize the phylogenetic tree using **MEGA**.
- Analyze the tree to identify evolutionary relationships and genetic diversity among the variants.
- Interpret the tree to determine the origin and transmission pathways of the pathogen.

## Results and Findings
- Successfully reconstructed an evolutionary tree illustrating the relationships among 10 ebolavirus variants.
- Identified genetic markers and evolutionary trends associated with recent outbreaks.
- Provided insights into transmission dynamics and the likely origins of the 2014 outbreak in Guinea.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of computational phylogenetic methods to analyze the evolution of ebolaviruses. The findings enhance our understanding of their genetic diversity and transmission patterns, contributing to improved outbreak management and vaccine development.
